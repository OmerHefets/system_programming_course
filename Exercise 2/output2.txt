Please enter the values for the adjacency matrix. the Matrix is a 5x5 matrix, with values 0 / 1.
Therefore, insert 5 values in each row, seperated with space in between and finish the row with newline:
The resulted matrix is:
        0       1       2       3       4

0       0       0       0       0       0
1       0       0       1       0       0
2       0       0       0       0       0
3       0       0       0       0       1
4       1       1       0       0       0
Please insert two indexes of nodes in tree, to check for path from the first node to the second one (-1 and -1 to exit):
The first index is: 3
The second index is: 2
And there IS a path from 3 to 2, as the value is TRUE
