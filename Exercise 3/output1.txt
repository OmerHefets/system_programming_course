Hello. this program executes commands on complex numbers as you define.
There are six complex numbers defined in this program: A, B, C, D, E, F. It's not possible to define more.
All complexes are reset to zero at the beginning. When reqested to, insert a command in the following way:
"command_name" "arg1", "arg2", "arg3"
make sure to have a comma between each argument, and not at the end / before the first arg. white chars are ignored everywhere.
The following commands are possible: reading complex, printing complex, adding, subtracting, multiplying or abs:
Reading a number: "read_comp" "complex_name", "number_arg", "number_arg"
Printing a number: "print_comp" "complex_name"
Adding two numbers: "add_comp" "complex_name", "complex_name"
Subtracting two numbers: "sub_comp" "complex_name", "complex_name"
Multiplying a complex number with a real number: "mult_comp_real" "complex_name", "number_arg"
Multiplying a complex number with an imaginary number:"mult_comp_img" "complex_name", "number_arg"
Multiplying two complex numbers: "mult_comp_comp" "complex_name", "complex_name"
Calculate the abs of the complex number: "abs_comp" "complex_name"
Stop the program: "stop"
